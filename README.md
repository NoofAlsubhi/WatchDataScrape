# 🕵️‍♂️ Czapek Watch Data Scraper & Automation 



## 📝 Project Overview

Me and my teammates, our mission is to provide actionable insights through data. With the Czapek brand, we're focused on delivering accurate and detailed information about their timepieces. Our project unfolds in two key phases:

### 🚀 Phase 1: Data Collection and Analysis
Our initial task is to meticulously scrape data from the Czapek website. This includes extracting details such as model names, prices, materials, and more. Once we've collected the data, we'll analyze it to derive meaningful insights.

### ⏰ Phase 2: Automation and Deployment
After completing Phase 1, we transition to automating the data collection process. This involves converting our Python notebook into a robust script, setting up automation on an AWS EC2 instance, and containerizing the application for seamless deployment.
